# ahmed_aly As CSV

Python script that takes an ahmed-aly standing and returns a csv with the submissions information.
This was tested only on Linux.

# What will I need in order to run it?

- selenium
- cssselect
- csv
- lxml.html
- some internet connection will help haha :smile: (but really, you'll need it)

# Ok, but how do I run it?

Run it on shell:

`$python runApp.py <ID of the standings> -o <name/path of the output>`

If the name/path of the output isn't explicit the output will be `<Standings name>.csv`
